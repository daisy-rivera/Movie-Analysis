    "Part 4\n",
    "For part 4 of the project, you will be using your MySQL database from part 3 to answer meaningful questions for your stakeholder. They want you to use your hypothesis testing and statistics knowledge to answer 3 questions about what makes a successful movie.\n",
    "- Questions to Answer\n",
    "1. The stakeholder's first question is: does the MPAA rating of a movie (G/PG/PG-13/R) affect how much revenue the movie generates?\n",
    "\n",
    "- They want you to perform a statistical test to get a mathematically-supported answer.\n",
    "- They want you to report if you found a significant difference between ratings.\n",
    "- If so, what was the p-value of your analysis?\n",
    "- And which rating earns the most revenue?\n",
    "- They want you to prepare a visualization that supports your finding.\n",
    "2. It is then up to you to think of 2 additional hypotheses to test that your stakeholder may want to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some example hypotheses you could test:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do movies that are over 2.5 hours long earn more revenue than movies that are 1.5 hours long (or less)?\n",
    "- Do movies released in 2020 earn less revenue than movies released in 2018?\n",
    "- How do the years compare for movie ratings?\n",
    "- Do some movie genres earn more revenue than others?\n",
    "- Are some genres higher rated than others?\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Data\n",
    "1. A critical first step for this assignment will be to retrieve additional movie data to add to your SQL database.\n",
    "- You will want to use the TMDB API again and extract data for additional years.\n",
    "- You may want to review the optional lesson from Week 1 on \"Using glob to Load Many Files\" to load and combine all of your API results for each year.\n",
    "- However, trying to extract the TMDB data for all movies from 2000-2022 could take >24 hours!\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, you should EITHER:\n",
    "- Define a smaller (but logical) period of time to use for your analyses (e.g. last 10 years, 2010-2019 (pre-pandemic, etc).\n",
    "- OR coordinate with cohort-mates and divide the API calls so that you can all download the data for a smaller number of years and then share your downloaded JSON data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should use the same project repository you have been using for Parts 1-3 (for your portfolio).\n",
    "- Create a new notebook in your project repository just for the hypothesis testing (like \"Part 4 - Hypothesis Testing.ipynb\")\n",
    "- Make sure the results and visualization for all 3 hypotheses are in your notebook.\n",
    "- Please submit the link to your GitHub repository for this assignmen"
